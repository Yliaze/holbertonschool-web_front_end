## Project Overview
This project focuses on building the front end of an AirBnB clone step-by-step. The initial step involves designing and prototyping each element by creating simple HTML static pages.

Before diving into the styling and design aspect, it's essential to understand and establish the structure of the HTML pages. HTML provides the foundation and structure of the web pages, while CSS adds the styling and visual appeal. It is recommended to prioritize building a solid HTML structure before proceeding with the design.
